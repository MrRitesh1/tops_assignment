What is Redux?

Redux is simply a store to store the state of the variables in your app. 
Redux creates a process and procedures to interact with the store so that 
components will not just update or read the store randomly. Similar to the bank. 
It does not mean because you have money in the bank that you can go anytime, open 
the vault, and take money. You have to go through certain steps to withdrawal money.

In the rest of the article, I will show how to create a Redux Hello World to 
explain how Redux works before adding it to React.

In short, Redux is a way to manage the “state” or we can say it is a cache or 

storage that can be accessed by all components with a structured way. It has to 
be accessed through a “Reducer” and “Actions”
